PA 7 Name: Triage Facility and Heaps
Description: This PA implements a patient triage service using the data
structure Heap. There are also files that implement a heapsort algorithm
also using the heap data structure.
Features: The patient triage service is based on a heap with patient name
being the value and absolute value 100 - patient age being the priority (for
creating a Tuple). The patients are ordered by priority, with the greatest
priority patient served first using heappop().
