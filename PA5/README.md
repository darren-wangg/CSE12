Name: Hashmaps and Queues
Description: This PA implements a mail delivery service using the data
structures HashMap and Queue.
Features: The mail delivery service is based on a HashMap with keys being
Deliverable objects' zip codes (MyMail or MyPackage objects with various qualities), linked to values, being MyQueue objects (a Queue of individual Deliverable objects). The Mailroom.java file allows for the registering, delivering, and merging of Deliverable objects, emulating an actual mail service.
