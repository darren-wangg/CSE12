1. PA 1: Unit Testing and Mocking
2. This PA has three main Test files, TestController.java,
   TestStudent.java, and TestResponse.java, that implement multiple testing
   methods to determine whether the original class' functionality works as
   it is supposed to.
3. The Test.java classes have multiple methods that test the output of all
   methods in the corresponding Controller, Response, and Student classes.
   The test is considered passing if the expected output matches the actual
   output achieved when running the method. We compare expected and actual
   using the Assert. methods.
